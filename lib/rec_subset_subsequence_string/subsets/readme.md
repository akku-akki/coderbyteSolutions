Subset=> 
* Permutations and combinations
* subsets = > non adjacentCollections
 eg => [3,5,9] ans => [3] [3,5] [5] [3,9] [3,9,5] [9]

  sets and permutation are different

  permutation is in how many different ways can arrange

 * recurssion and iteration

 problem have 2 steps
  1. what we are doing 
  2. how we are doing

  NOT BEFORE APPLYING =>
 *  This pattern of taking some elements and removing some 
 is known as this subset pattern

 subsset => array
 subSequence => string

 * when you find a duplicate element only add it in the newly created subset
 of previous step

 * because of above points duplicates have to be together soln => Sort the array
